The prototype of a duck hunt game with elements of a clicker game could involve the player using a mouse to shoot units that fly across the screen. The player would earn points for each duck they successfully shoot, and the score would be displayed on the screen. The units would move at varying speeds and directions, making it more challenging for the player to hit them.

The game could also have levels with increasing difficulty, such as more units appearing on the screen at once or the units moving faster.

Overall, this prototype would combine the fast-paced action of a duck hunt game with the incremental progression and upgrades of a clicker game, creating a unique and challenging experience for players.
